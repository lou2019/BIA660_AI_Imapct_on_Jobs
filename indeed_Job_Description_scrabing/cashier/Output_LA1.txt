Yoshinoya America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Yoshinoya Holdings, based in Japan.

The American subsidiary has over 100 stores (70+ company owned) and is Southern California's best kept secret.
Yoshinoya America has quietly reinvented itself over the past 4 years under a new leadership team. New brand positioning, menu items, remodels, upgraded systems, and improved execution have resulted in comp-store sales increases of more than 25%. During the same period, the QSR segment has seen little if any sales growth. Our remaining stores will be remodeled this year as we start to open restaurants in new markets.

You owe it to yourself to take a closer look at Yoshinoya and use our success as your springboard to new career opportunities
