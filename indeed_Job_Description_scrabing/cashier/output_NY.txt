In 1762, John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich, had his hands full, literally. As First Sea Lord, he commanded the mighty British Navy, was a noted explorer, and also a dedicated gambler with a love of day long card games.
This led to little time for food, so he came up with the ingenious idea (some say at the card table) of putting meat between two slices of bread. From then on it did not matter if you were fighting a great sea battle or laying down a Royal Flush, you could eat great food without too much fuss.
Thus in 1762, the sandwich was named after its inventor, John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich. Now 250 years later, the current 11th Earl and the Sandwich family remain passionate about the world's most popular quick food that carries their name and have developed the sandwich everyone has been waiting for…The World's Greatest Hot Sandwich® We are looking for individuals to continue the tradition!

About the Syracuse area
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues.

The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.

Stew Leonard’s WINES began when Stew Leonard, Jr., the CEO and President of Stew Leonard’s food stores and his two sisters, Jill and Beth, and brother, Tom, were sitting at the dinner table. They realized the only item on the table that their business did not sell was the wine. The meal was fantastic, but the wine was just ok. Stew said to his sisters, “We can do better. Don’t you agree?”After studying the industry, taking multiple courses and traveling to numerous wineries, Beth L. Hollis, Stew’s sister, opened her wine store in Yonkers, New York, in 1999. Beth, Stew and family decided to take their decades of retail experience in the food business and apply it to wine. They agreed that any store, which opened under the “Stew Leonard’s” trademark, would offer customers a friendly, well-trained staff and a clean, organized store. We want any customer in a Stew Leonard’s store to feel comfortable asking questions about wine and to enjoy it as much as we do. Stew and his other sister, Jill went on to open their own wine shops as well. The Stew Leonard’s Mark is a registered trademark or service mark of Stew Leonard’s, a Connecticut partnership and is registered in the United States. Each wine store is independently owned and operated and is not part of a cooperative buying group or affiliated with the Stew Leonard’s food stores. Stew Leonard's Wines and Spirits of Yonkers is looking forward to the Holiday Season! We need some extra sets of hands to help with the anticipated increased business.
