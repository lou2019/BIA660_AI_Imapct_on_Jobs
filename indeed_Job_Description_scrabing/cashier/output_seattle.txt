Join the Tutta Bella Crew at our new counter concept in Kirkland Urban. We are bringing our traditional wood fired pizzas that made us Northwest famous and adding some delicious grab and go items to our new location inside the next generation Kirkland Urban QFC - right next to their Q20 brew pub.
Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location. Ultimately Tutta Bella Crew members are responsible for executing our purpose of “Nourishing lives by sharing traditions, authentic food and love,” and providing a memorable guest experience to every guest.

Embrace and support our core collaborative value of tip pooling. We believe that all hourly employees are important to creating a memorable guest experience and should share in customer tips. It is also our experience that this collaborative effort breaks down barriers and wage disparities that can exist between the “front and back houses” of some restaurants to the detriment of the guest experience and work environment.
Demonstrate product and operational knowledge and perform well during high volume periods.
Maintain required permits such as food handler’s permit and demonstrate knowledge of health code regulations.

Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location.

Join the Tutta Bella Crew at our new counter concept in Kirkland Urban. We are bringing our traditional wood fired pizzas that made us Northwest famous and adding some delicious grab and go items to our new location inside the next generation Kirkland Urban QFC - right next to their Q20 brew pub.
Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location. Ultimately Tutta Bella Crew members are responsible for executing our purpose of “Nourishing lives by sharing traditions, authentic food and love,” and providing a memorable guest experience to every guest. The way we accomplish this is through our adherence to Neapolitan traditions, following our proven recipes and systems, showing genuine care for our guests and teammates, and enjoying making people happy.

Join the Tutta Bella Crew at our new counter concept in Kirkland Urban. We are bringing our traditional wood fired pizzas that made us Northwest famous and adding some delicious grab and go items to our new location inside the next generation Kirkland Urban QFC - right next to their Q20 brew pub.
Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location. Ultimately Tutta Bella Crew members are responsible for executing our purpose of “Nourishing lives by sharing traditions, authentic food and love,” and providing a memorable guest experience to every guest.

Join the Tutta Bella Crew at our new counter concept in Kirkland Urban. We are bringing our traditional wood fired pizzas that made us Northwest famous and adding some delicious grab and go items to our new location inside the next generation Kirkland Urban QFC - right next to their Q20 brew pub.
Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location. Ultimately Tutta Bella Crew members are responsible for executing our purpose of “Nourishing lives by sharing traditions, authentic food and love,” and providing a memorable guest experience to every guest.

Embrace and support our core collaborative value of tip pooling. We believe that all hourly employees are important to creating a memorable guest experience and should share in customer tips. It is also our experience that this collaborative effort breaks down barriers and wage disparities that can exist between the “front and back houses” of some restaurants to the detriment of the guest experience and work environment.
Demonstrate product and operational knowledge and perform well during high volume periods.
Maintain required permits such as food handler’s permit and demonstrate knowledge of health code regulations.
Remain coachable and eager to improve the quality of the service and products we provide.

Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location.

Join the Tutta Bella Crew at our new counter concept in Kirkland Urban. We are bringing our traditional wood fired pizzas that made us Northwest famous and adding some delicious grab and go items to our new location inside the next generation Kirkland Urban QFC - right next to their Q20 brew pub.
Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location. Ultimately Tutta Bella Crew members are responsible for executing our purpose of “Nourishing lives by sharing traditions, authentic food and love,” and providing a memorable guest experience to every guest.

Join the Tutta Bella Crew at our new counter concept in Kirkland Urban. We are bringing our traditional wood fired pizzas that made us Northwest famous and adding some delicious grab and go items to our new location inside the next generation Kirkland Urban QFC - right next to their Q20 brew pub.
Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location. Ultimately Tutta Bella Crew members are responsible for executing our purpose of “Nourishing lives by sharing traditions, authentic food and love,” and providing a memorable guest experience to every guest.

Demonstrate product and operational knowledge and perform well during high volume periods.
Maintain required permits such as food handler’s permit and demonstrate knowledge of health code regulations.

Join the Tutta Bella Crew at our new counter concept in Kirkland Urban. We are bringing our traditional wood fired pizzas that made us Northwest famous and adding some delicious grab and go items to our new location inside the next generation Kirkland Urban QFC - right next to their Q20 brew pub.
Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location. Ultimately Tutta Bella Crew members are responsible for executing our purpose of “Nourishing lives by sharing traditions, authentic food and love,” and providing a memorable guest experience to every guest. The way we accomplish this is through our adherence to Neapolitan traditions, following our proven recipes and systems, showing genuine care for our guests and teammates, and enjoying making people happy.

Embrace and support our core collaborative value of tip pooling. We believe that all hourly employees are important to creating a memorable guest experience and should share in customer tips. It is also our experience that this collaborative effort breaks down barriers and wage disparities that can exist between the “front and back houses” of some restaurants to the detriment of the guest experience and work environment.
Demonstrate product and operational knowledge and perform well during high volume periods.
Maintain required permits such as food handler’s permit and demonstrate knowledge of health code regulations.
Remain coachable and eager to improve the quality of the service and products we provide.

Join the Tutta Bella Crew at our new counter concept in Kirkland Urban. We are bringing our traditional wood fired pizzas that made us Northwest famous and adding some delicious grab and go items to our new location inside the next generation Kirkland Urban QFC - right next to their Q20 brew pub.
Tutta Bella Crew members work at our counter service concepts either demonstrating the pizzaiolo skills to slap and open the dough, top the pizzas and cook them in our Italian wood fired ovens or performing the customer facing skills necessary to provide our guests with a memorable experience and helping with cutting pizzas, etc... or ideally, both. In addition to our Neapolitan pizzas, the Tutta Bella Crew will be providing guests with Italian sandwiches, lasagna, salads, tiramisu and fresh Sicilian cannoli from our counter service location. Ultimately Tutta Bella Crew members are responsible for executing our purpose of “Nourishing lives by sharing traditions, authentic food and love,” and providing a memorable guest experience to every guest.
