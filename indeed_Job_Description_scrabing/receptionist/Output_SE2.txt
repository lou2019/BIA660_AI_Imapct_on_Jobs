Now Hiring! Himalayan Pet Supply is looking for an Administrative Assistant/Customer Service Associate to join our pack.
Himalayan Pet Supply began in 2003 with two brothers, a friend and his dog, Kaos. Kaos discovered ‘churpi’ and he loved it!
We spent the next four years re-engineering the people-grade cheese to make it lactose free and safe for dogs. In 2007, we launched our new dog chew at a small pet fair in Bellingham, Washington creating a new category in the industry, thus changing the dog chew class significantly.
By 2016, we became a leader in the industry as we expanded out into other pet categories, transforming our company from a single product oriented business to a pet supply company. We now offer retailers not just a single chew, but treats, toys and gear as well. We’ve set our sights on outfitting your whole pack and becoming the top most trusted brand pet in the pet industry.
Want to learn more about our success story and the difference we continue making? Come join us and be a part of our amazing team!
