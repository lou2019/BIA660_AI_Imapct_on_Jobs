About House Ear Clinic House Ear Clinic grew from the one-man practice established by Howard P. House, M.D. After completing his residency training in 1938, he travelled throughout the United States and Europe visiting renowned physicians and learning the latest treatments for patients with eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT) problems. In 1939 Howard began to practice EENT at the Moore-White Clinic in Los Angeles. Four years later, he opened his own practice and limited his practice to ears, nose, and throat (ENT). By this time his interest was focused on the area of ear surgery and he was one of the first ear surgeons to perform fenestration surgery, an operation to restore hearing. House Ear Clinic Downtown Los Angeles, CA Welcome Welcome to House Ear Clinic (House). House refers to all employees of House Ear Clinic. House has always been a special place to work, since Dr. Howard P. House founded the business more than 77 years ago. Over these past decades, the company has experienced great success and highly regarded in the industry – yet we’ve never lost sight of the mission that defines House. As our Founder, Dr. House simply put it, “To help people hear life the way it was meant to”. We accomplish House’s mission and goals by hiring the best employees, and by following House’s strong culture. We hope that as a House employee, you will uphold House’s culture and continue its mission, which begins with joining House and will continue House History House Ear Clinic grew from the one-man practice established by Howard P. House, M.D. After completing his residency training in 1938, he travelled throughout the United States and Europe visiting renowned physicians and learning the latest treatments for patients with eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT) problems. In 1939 Howard began to practice EENT at the Moore-White Clinic in Los Angeles. Four years later, he opened his own practice and limited his practice to ears, nose, and throat (ENT). By this time his interest was focused on the area of ear surgery and he was one of the first ear surgeons to perform fenestration surgery, an operation to restore hearing. In 1946 Howard founded the House Ear Institute as the Los Angeles Foundation of Otology, a private non-profit foundation. The threefold mission of the Institute encompasses Otology Education, Research, and Global Health. By 1947 he was performing so many hearing restoration surgeries that he limited his practice even further and concentrated on the treatment of ear related problems only. In 1956 his brother William F. House, M.D. joined him in practice. By 1958 two additional ear surgeons, James Sheehy, M.D. and Fred Linthicum, M.D., had joined Howard and William House to form the Otologic Medical Group. By this time, the practice of ear surgery had advanced to the point where patients with hearing loss due to otosclerosis or chronic ear infections could have their hearing surgically restored. Other advances by the Group included reducing the mortality rate of patients undergoing acoustic neuroma surgery from 40% to near 0% and developing treatments for patients with vertigo due to Meniere’s Disease and other causes. The physicians along with House Ear Institute scientists also developed and perfected the cochlear implant and authority brain stem implant for patients who are totally deaf. In 1990 the practice moved into a new facility and changed it’s name from Otologic Medical Group to House Ear Clinic. The practice consists of 10 ear specialists 7 of whom perform ear surgery. One of the associates specializes in allergic diseases of the ear.

Location Renaissance Long Beach Hotel, 111 East Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, California, United States VIEW ON MAP
Brand Renaissance Hotels
Schedule Full-time
Position Type Non-Management/Hourly Start Your Journey With Us
You were always one of those curious kids who opened every cabinet, peeked behind every door, and never ceased to ask "why" when given an explanation. Today, you bring your personal style to every experience. You live life to discover. You are passionate about your neighborhood, always looking to explore the places one wouldn’t find in a travel guide. If this sounds like you, you’re in the right place. You’ve got authentic style, natural curiosity and a warm way with people. Renaissance is not just a place to spend the night, it's a place to discover, a place in the world with style like yours. That’s why we’re not just looking for anyone. We’re looking for someone like you. Job Summary
As a Renaissance Front Desk Ambassador, you are one of the first ambassadors that a guest comes into contact with and your friendly, authentic approach creates a unique and personalized guest experience when the guest checks in. The successful Front Desk Ambassador will tailor their approach by reading cues from a guest to ensure when they check in the guest feels at home. At Renaissance we believe that every ambassador is an innovator, explorer, and relationship builder, someone who is able to identify the key details that make something uniquely interesting and provide guests with intriguing information about the locale.
Creating a smooth and easy experience for guests so they can get the most out of their stay is critical. The Front Desk Ambassador will use their expertise, as well as their relationships with others across the hotel (from housekeeping to parking to the Navigator and beyond), to anticipate and deliver on our guests’ needs. He or she should be passionate not only about the locale and local offerings, but also have an eye for detail – from the information they provide to guests, to the accuracy of their reports, to the transactions they process and secure.
No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – making sure you have a safe work environment, following company policies and procedures, ensuring your uniform and personal appearance are clean and professional, maintaining confidentiality, complying with quality assurance standards, and protecting company assets. The front desk ambassador role will be on your feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended period of time) and taking a hands-on approach to your work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 10 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other things that come your way) is the foundation of the job. Ultimately, the real hallmark of the Front Desk Ambassador role is driving a best-in-class guest experience, inspiring guests and associates alike to live life to discover. Marriott International is an equal opportunity employer committed to hiring a diverse workforce and sustaining an inclusive culture. Marriott International does not discriminate on the basis of disability, veteran status or any other basis protected under federal, state or local laws.
